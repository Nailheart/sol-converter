        <h2>Sol</h2>
        <p>One sol is the duration of a solar day on Mars, which is slightly longer than an Earth day. Specifically, one sol on Mars is approximately 24 hours and 39 minutes long, or about 1.027 Earth days. The exact length of a Martian day can vary slightly depending on the time of year and other factors, but this is a good approximation.</p>
